    "For many students—and even graduate researchers—their first real encounter with spectral analysis often unfolds like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, they spot an interesting phenomenon in a time-domain signal and excitedly share it with their advisor or senior colleagues. The advisor responds calmly: “You should try some Fourier or wavelet analysis.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The student returns to their desk, thinking “How hard can Fourier analysis be?” They pull out their old calculus textbook, flip through a few pages, and quickly realize it’s not going to help. So they turn to the tried-and-true method: Googling “Fourier Analysis tutorial” while also searching “How to do Fourier/wavelet time-frequency analysis in Matlab / Python / IDL.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, they stumble upon a Digital Signal Processing textbook with a stellar 9.8 rating on Douban. “This must be the key!” they think. After a marathon weekend, they manage to get through the 50+ pages of Chapter 1, Signals and Systems. But by Chapter 2, Linear Time-Invariant Systems, fatigue sets in—only to realize that the actual Fourier series material lies more than 120 pages ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, most students pragmatically pivot to StackOverflow, grabbing a ready-to-use code snippet to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few determined souls, however, soldier on—spending days gathering materials, watching online lectures, coding, and preparing a comprehensive report. They proudly submit it to their advisor, only to be met with the classic understated feedback: “Why so little progress this week?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The above story is, of course, entirely fictional. Any resemblance to actual persons or events is purely coincidental. And if anyone asks, “What’s the point of writing this? Who told you to? What’s your real intention?”—well, that too is just a joke!\n",
