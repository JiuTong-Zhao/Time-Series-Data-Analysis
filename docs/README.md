The purpose of this document stems from:

- **<u>The Spectral Analysis is Useful</u>**: Signals are encountered in every single day of life, which can be seen, heard, or felt, like a whistling sound. Most of you can definitely sense the variation of the signal, while you may find it hard to describe. Even though the original time series reveals something about the waveform and wave frequency, some aspects, such as the harmonics, are still difficult to obtain. The processing of such signals is a fundamental task in many fields, including physics, engineering, and data science. With a suitable analysis method, you can easily extract the information from the signal, such as the chirping signature of the bird singing.

- **<u>A Practical Handbook is Required</u>**: However, if you start learning it from the beginning, you may need to flip through a 500-page textbook, which is not only time-consuming but also requires a solid mathematical background. The concise mathematical definition, like ***compact support***, is of no use in your own research but burns your patience and time. Moreover, it is hard for you to get a practical usage example with Python from these theoretical notebooks. 

This document aims to provide a **practical guide** to spectral analysis, focusing on the essential concepts and practical applications. It is designed to be accessible to those with a basic understanding of Python and signal processing, without delving too deeply into the mathematical intricacies, which are accessible in the classic, highly-rated notebooks.

Also, there will not be an introduction like "What is Signals", "What is Time Series". If you need it (them), please take a shower, brew a bottle of coffee, and read the classic notebook.
